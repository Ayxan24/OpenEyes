# OpenEyes
OpenEyes is a lightweight desktop activity recorder designed to capture your screen at **1 FPS** with almost **zero performance impact**.  
The long-term goal is to feed the captured frames into a **local AI model** to generate daily activity summaries — all while keeping your data private.
This project desinged to work on Linux.
## 🔧 Dependancies
- Python
- Either FFMPEG or WFrecorder or GPUScreenRecorder
- (Planned) Local LLM integration
## 🚀 Features
- Ultra-low FPS screen recording (1 frame per second)
- Minimal CPU/GPU usage
- Modular pipeline for future AI analysis
- Privacy-focused (local processing planned)
- Open-source project in active development
## 🎯 Project Vision
OpenEyes aims to help users analyze how they spend their time using **AI-assisted daily summaries** without uploading anything to external servers.

Planned additions:
- Frame-to-text model for activity descriptions  
- Daily timeline reports  
- Local LLM integration  
- Customizable privacy options  

## 🧩 Current Status
- Basic 1 FPS recording prototype complete  
- FPS → image pipeline working  
- AI processing model not yet integrated  

## 🤝 Contributing
This project is still in early development. Suggestions, issues, and contributions are welcome.
